- The project

A video game based on the advance war game in GBA

- About myself

I'm a student in Epitech (France) who love code videos games and algorithm. I work with one of my friend who give me pictures.
I'm 20 years old and a great inspiration.

- The purpose of the project

It's to create a game who can be played by one or to player. It's also to learn about the video game creation.
